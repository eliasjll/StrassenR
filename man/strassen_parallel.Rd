\title{Parallel Strassen's Matrix Multiplication}
\usage{
strassen_parallel(A, B, threshold = 64L)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{A numeric matrix.}

\item{B}{A numeric matrix.}

\item{threshold}{The matrix size at which the algorithm switches from Strassen's
recursion to a naive multiplication. Defaults to 64.}
}
\value{
The matrix product of A and B.
}
\description{
Computes the matrix product of two matrices using a parallelized, hybrid
version of Strassen's algorithm. This is the fastest implementation in the
package for large matrices. It uses a threshold to switch to a naive
algorithm for smaller sub-problems and OpenMP to parallelize the recursive calls.
